                        details: `Related historical event: The Two Constitutional Protection Movements<br><br>1. Background:<br><br>(1) After Yuan Shikai seized the fruits of the revolution, on August 11, 1913, Long Jiguang was appointed Military Governor of Guangdong and acting Civil Administrator. During his rule, uprisings led by revolutionaries such as Deng Keng, Zhu Zhixin, and Zhong Mingguang repeatedly failed. It was not until 1916, under pressure from Guangdong’s public, that the Beijing government was forced to revoke Long Jiguang’s appointment. Lu Rongting entered Guangzhou, marking the end of Long’s rule and the beginning of the Guangxi warlords' occupation of Guangdong.<br><br>(2) After Yuan Shikai’s death in 1916, the "President-Premier Dispute" erupted. In July 1917, Zhang Xun staged a monarchist restoration. On July 6, Duan Qirui "reestablished the republic" but refused to restore the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China or reconvene the National Assembly.<br><br>2. Process:<br><br>(1) On July 22, 1917, Cheng Biguang led the navy from Shanghai to Guangzhou to uphold the constitution.<br><br>(2) On September 1, Sun Yat-sen was elected Grand Marshal of the Military Government. On September 10, he took the oath of office, formally establishing the Military Government.<br><br>(3) The Guangxi, Zhili, and Yunnan warlords colluded, and under pressure from the southwestern warlords, Sun was forced to resign as Grand Marshal on May 4, 1918, marking the failure of the First Constitutional Protection Movement.<br><br>(4) In 1920, Sun Yat-sen adopted the strategy of "allying with Duan Qirui to eliminate Guangxi warlord rule in Guangdong before pursuing national unification."<br><br>(5) The Extraordinary Parliament was reconvened, the Military Government was dissolved, and a Presidential Office was established, marking the second formation of the Constitutional Protection Government.<br><br>(6) In August 1921, the Guangxi warlords were defeated, unifying Guangdong and Guangxi, and preparations for the Northern Expedition began. However, Chen Jiongming launched an open rebellion, leading to the failure of the Second Constitutional Protection Movement.`,
