It stands as a testament to Guangzhou' s origins as the political and cultural center of Lingnan. <br><br>
2. Details: 
        (1) Background: The Nanyue Kingdom, also known as the Southern Yue Kingdom, was a regime established in the Lingnan region during the late Qin to early Western Han period. At the fall of the Qin Dynasty, Zhao Tuo, the military commander of Nanhai Commandery, sealed off the borders and annexed the neighboring Guilin and Xiang Commanderies. In 204 BCE, he officially founded the Nanyue Kingdom, with Panyu (modern Guangzhou) as its capital. In 196 BCE, the kingdom became a vassal state of the Han Dynasty. In 113 BCE, L√º Jia, the kingdom's chancellor, staged a rebellion, killing King Zhao Xing and installing Zhao Jiande as the new ruler. In the autumn of 112 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han launched a military campaign against Nanyue, leading to its conquest in the winter of 111 BCE. The kingdom lasted 93 years under five successive rulers.<br><br>  
        (2) Features: The site has revealed large-scale palace foundations, brick-paved pathways, wells, and other structures. Among them, the curved stone waterway (an artificial garden water system) is the earliest known example of imperial garden hydraulics in China, demonstrating the Nanyue Kingdom's adoption of Central Plains‚Äìstyle construction practices.

                        details: `1. Overview:  
   Legend has it that this is where five immortals descended on five rams, bringing ears of grain‚Äîthe origin of Guangzhou's nicknames "City of Rams" (Yangcheng) and "City of Grain (Suicheng)." The temple houses the "First Tower of Lingnan" (Bell Tower), a Ming Dynasty structure, and is deeply rooted in Guangzhou's cultural heritage.  
<br><br>
2.Details:
(1) The Legend:  
     During the reign of King Yi of Zhou (9th century BCE), five celestial beings riding five-colored rams descended upon Guangzhou (then called "Chuting"), offering sheaves of grain to the people and blessing the land with everlasting abundance. After the immortals departed, the rams turned to stone, giving rise to Guangzhou's iconic names.  <br><br>

(2) Historical Development:  
    Pre-Song Dynasty: The earliest worship site for the Five Immortals was likely near modern Xihu Road (ancient "Poshan"), but due to shifts in the Pearl River's coastline, it was later relocated.  
     - Northern Song (11th century): A temple dedicated to the Five Immortals existed in Guangzhou, though its exact location is unclear.  
     - Ming Dynasty (1377): The temple was officially moved to its current site (Huifu West Road) and expanded under government patronage, becoming a key Taoist center.  
     - 1465‚Äì1487 (Chenghua Era): The temple was renovated, adding structures like the Bell Tower and ceremonial gates.  
     - 1573‚Äì1620 (Wanli Era): Further expansions made it one of Guangzhou' s primary Taoist hubs.  
     - Qing Dynasty (1723): Another major restoration gave the temple its current Qing-era architectural style.  
     -Late Qing‚ÄìRepublic of China: Wars and social changes led to decline, with parts of the temple damaged or repurposed.  
     - 1980s: Listed as a Guangzhou Cultural Heritage Site, restoration began.  
     - 2005: Recognized as a Guangdong Provincial Protected Heritage Site, including the First Tower of Lingnan (Bell Tower).  
     - Post-2010: Opened as a historical attraction, featuring the "Traces of Ancient Guangzhou" exhibition.  <br><br>
 
(3) Architecture & Relics: 
     <1> Mountain Gate (Shanmen): Ming-style entrance with a plaque reading "Five Immortals Ancient Temple."  
     <2> Rear Hall (Five Immortals Shrine): Houses statues of the immortals and a Ming Dynasty stone carving of a "celestial footprint" (said to be left by the immortals).  
     <3> First Tower of Lingnan (Bell Tower): Built in 1374 (Ming Hongwu Era), it holds a massive Ming bronze bell‚Äîthe oldest surviving bell tower in Guangzhou.  
     <4> "Forbidden Bell Tower": The bell was banned during the Qing Dynasty due to beliefs that its sound disrupted imperial examination feng shui.  
     <5> Ancient Tablets & Inscriptions: Includes Ming-Qing stele like the "Record of Rebuilding Five Immortals Temple."  <br><br>
  
 (4) Significance:  
     The legend reflects Lingnan' s agricultural origins, and the temple is regarded as Guangzhou's "historical core."

2. Details:
History: Founded in 1233 as a sandbank settlement in the Pearl River estuary. In 1275, the He family clan, led by ancestor He Deming, settled here and built the Liugengtang (He Clan Ancestral Hall), establishing Shawan's clan-based society. Became the seat of the "Shawan Si" administrative district during the Yuan Dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty, governed parts of modern Panyu, Nansha, and Shunde. The He clan prospered through imperial exams (producing 12 Jinshi scholars), building numerous Diu Ngo Lou houses and temples. The Beidi Deity Parade ritual evolved into the Shawan Piaose tradition. Commerce thrived in the Qing Dynasty, forming four major markets. Guangdong Music originated here in the 18th century; the He family built the Sanren Hall as a music hub. Overseas Chinese funded modern schools like Yucai Primary. After the Opium War, it became a cultural crossroads. Traditional crafts (brick carving, lime sculpture) continued into the Republic era, with composers like He Liutang creating classics like "Scrambling for the Dragon Pearl". Core structures survived WWII damage.

1. .Overview: As one of Guangzhou‚Äôs three traditional commercial hubs, Shangxiajiu is a pedestrian street showcasing a unique blend of Western and local Xiguan charm.<br><br>
2.Details:
(1) Development: As early as the 520s AD, this area emerged as a commercial cluster. It was once called "Xilai Chudi" ("the first landing place of the West") because of Bodhidharma, an Indian monk, landed here to spread Buddhism. During the Song Dynasty, the lower section (Xiajiu Road) was known as Xiuyifang, forming Xiguan‚Äôs earliest commercial settlement. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, with the establishment of Huaiyuan Post , the opening of Daguan River, and the rise of the thirteen-hongs in Canton as a key foreign trade port, wealthy merchants-built residences in Xiguan, followed by shops selling Suzhou-Hangzhou goods, foreign products, and teahouses. By this time, Shangxiajiu was already a bustling business area. In 1937, the thirteen-hongs in Canton were destroyed by a fire spreading from nearby houses, and businesses gradually shifted to Shangxiajiu.
<br><br>
(2) Architecture: Stretching over 1,000 meters long, the arcade buildings of Shangxiajiu date back to the Qing Dynasty. They combine Southern European architectural features, Manchurian decorations from northern China, and traditional Xiguan styles. And they were designed to cope with Guangzhou‚Äôs rainy climate.`,

Over 2,000 years ago, areas west of today‚Äôs Guangfu Middle Road to Huangsha Road and Huagui Road were still underwater. More than a thousand years later, most of Xiguan became land, expanding further southward. Yongqing Fang, located in southwest Guangzhou, was once the most prosperous core of the city. However, as the city center shifted east, its buildings fell into disrepair. Thus, two renovation projects were carried out in 2016 and 2018.`,

2.Details: In 214 BC, Ren Xiao, the governor of Nanhai Commandery, built Panyu City near today‚Äôs Caidingqian (north section of Beijing Road). Before the Tang Dynasty, the area was mostly river channels and low-lying land. Beijing Road was founded in the Tang Dynasty, when brick-making techniques from central China spread to Guangzhou. The Tang-era road at the ancient ruins has 3 layers: two brick layers on top and a gravel layer below, confirming its role as a main artery. From the Tang to the Southern Han, a city layout with Beijing Road as the axis took shape. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Guangdong Administrative Province was located east of Beijing Road. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the chief secretary (administrative office) stood at the T-junction of Beijing Road and Zhongshan Fifth Road. After the 1911 Revolution, Yongqing Avenue was renamed Yonghan Street. In 1936, it became Hanmin Road, then reverted to Yonghan Road in the early 1950s, and finally took its current name, Beijing Road, on August 25, 1966.`,
